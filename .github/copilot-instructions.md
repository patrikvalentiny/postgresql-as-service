An app that you can use with your friends to track who drank how much during a night out / session.
Currently, the app is in the early stages of development, and we are looking for a developer to help us build it.
We are using postgres as our database
We do not have backend, rather we use postgrest to expose our database as a RESTful API.
We use react with vite and typescript for the frontend.
For styling we use tailwindcss 4.1 with daisyUI 5.0.
